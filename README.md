I'm SRP. I was a fine arts major, so naturally I've been working in the fun-filled field of Finance for the last umpteen years.
I started messing around with web design back when HTML4 was new, but I never took it anywhere past creating a couple of sites for friends. As you know, the technology now is much more fun and flexible, so I've found renewed interest.
